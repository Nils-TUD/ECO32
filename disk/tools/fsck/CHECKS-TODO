Assertions and Errors:
a) Assert: Every data block is either on the free list or is assigned
   to a single inode.
b) Error: An inode has nonzero link count, but its inode number does
   not appear in any directory.
c) Error: Format of the inode is incorrect (e.g., file type field has
   illegal value).
d) Error: Inode number appears in directory, but the inode is free.
e) Error: Number of free blocks recorded in super block != number of
   free blocks on disk.
f) Error: Number of free inodes recorded in super block != number of
   free inodes on disk.
g) Assert: Every inode in the free list must be free, i.e. has 0 as
   its mode.
h) Assert: An inode with link count n must appear in exactly n
   directory entries.
i) Assert: File size as given in the inode must be consistent with
   the data blocks assigned to the inode.
j) Assert: The root inode must be a directory.
k) Assert: Every directory must be reachable.
l) Assert: Every file must be referenced from some directory.
